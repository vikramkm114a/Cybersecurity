# Vulnerability Assessment 

## Scenario
You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

You are tasked with completing a vulnerability assessment of the situation to communicate the potential risks to decision makers at the company. You must create a written report that explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.

## Report 

Date : September 17th 2024

### System Desrcription
The database server runs on Debian Linux with 1TB of memory and powerful CPU processor. It hosts a MySQL database management system. The network connection uses IPV4 address, yet the security measure uses SSL instead of TLS.   

### Scope
The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system.
The assessment will cover a period of three months, from July 2024 to September 2024. NIST SP
800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

### Risk Assessment
The database server is a centralized computer system that stores and manages large amounts
of data. The server is used to store customer, campaign, and analytic data that can later be
analyzed to track performance and personalize marketing efforts. It is critical to secure the
system because of its regular use for marketing operations.

### Risk Assessment
| Threat source | Threat Event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| --- | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| Hackers | Sensitive information is leaked to public due to exfiltration | 3 | 3 | 9|
| Former employees | Sensitive information is leaked to the public or sold to competitors by the former employees | 2 | 3 | 6 |
| Current employees | Disrupt mission-critical operations | 2 | 3 | 6 |
| Customer | Alter/Delete information | 1 | 3 | 3| 

### Approach 
Threat source and events were identified based on likelihood of incidents due to open access permissions. The severity was measured against the impact on day-to-day operational needs. Some hackers might publish this information on the internet and bring down the organization's reputation. As for former employees, there was a case when they left the company and sold the confidential information to the competitors. While it might not happen easily, the severity is high. In addition, the current employees might disrupt operation activities, while customer may alter the information to their heart's content. 


### Remediation Strategy
* Make it private to protect the confidentiality
* Implement Role-Based Access (RBA)
* Implement authentication, authorization, and audit on the business practices to ensure only authorized users can gain access to the database server
* Implement multi-factor authentication (SMS, email, ID card, employee card, etc.)
* Encrypt the data using TLS instead of SSL (TLS is the new version of SSL) to prevent users from the internet to gain access to the database server
