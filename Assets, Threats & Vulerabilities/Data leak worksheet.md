# Data leak worksheet

## Scenario
You work for an educational technology company that developed an application to help teachers automatically grade assignments. The application handles a wide range of data that it collects from academic institutions, instructors, parents, and students.

Your team was alerted to a data leak of internal business plans on social media. An investigation by the team discovered that an employee accidentally shared those confidential documents with an external business partner. An audit into the leak is underway to determine how similar incidents can be avoided.

A supervisor provided you with information regarding the leak. It appears that the principle of least privilege was not observed by employees at the company during a sales meeting. You have been asked to analyze the situation and find ways to prevent it from happening again.

First, you'll need to evaluate details about the incident. Then, you'll review the controls in place to prevent data leaks. Next, you'll identify ways to improve information privacy at the company. Finally, you'll justify why you think your recommendations will make data handling at the company more secure.

## Incident Summary
Incident summary: A sales manager shared access to a folder of internal-only documents with their
team during a meeting. The folder contained files associated with a new product that has not been
publicly announced. It also included customer analytics and promotional materials. After the meeting,
the manager did not revoke access to the internal folder, but warned the team to wait for approval
before sharing the promotional materials with others.

During a video call with a business partner, a member of the sales team forgot the warning from their
manager. The sales representative intended to share a link to the promotional materials so that the
business partner could circulate the materials to their customers. However, the sales representative
accidentally shared a link to the internal folder instead. Later, the business partner posted the link on
their company's social media page assuming that it was the promotional materials.

| Control | Least Privilege |
|---|---|
| Issue(s) | Access to the internal folder was not limited to the sales team and the manager. The business partner should not have been given permission to share the promotional information to social media. | 
| Review | NIST SP 800-53: AC-6 addresses how an organization can protect their data privacy by implementing least privilege. It also suggests control enhancements to improve the effectiveness of least privilege. |
| Recommendation(s) | ● Restrict access to sensitive resources based on user role. <br> ● Regularly audit user privileges. |
| Justification | Data leaks can be prevented if shared links to internal files are restricted to employees only. Also, requiring managers and security teams to regularly audit access to team files would help limit the exposure of sensitive information. |
